I took part in the MIT Mystery Hunt recently. Didn't join Spore Giant this year - participated with my usual team kwargers (It used to be just shiny and I for a long time, but we just recently had a few friends join in and we're 5 strong on an extremely good day). Spending time with friends doing things I enjoy has made life's suffering gnaw at me a lot gentler.

A rooster just flew above my head. It crows for a metaphorical morning, a fresh start. It has to be so because it's currently 1pm in the afternoon.

I am writing this post among nature. An inchworm dangles from a branch in front of me on a silk thread. I am drawn to the vermilion peacock flowers in bloom - some of their pods are all dried up and ready to dehisce. I miss being an observer. I miss sitting in a field and staring up at the stars. I miss listening to and looking at birds as they hop by. Hobbies I've forgotten. I have been caught in the fierce current of chasing a dream for so long.

I will continue doing my best. And try not to lose myself in the process. But sitting here writing this, now, I am overwhelmed with the sweetness of life. Life is good :)
